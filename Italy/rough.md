Rome
Day One – 1/14
    • Scalina Spagna: “Spanish Steps” beautiful staircase.
    • Trevi Fountain: This is Rome’s largest and most-famous fountain - major crowds.
    • Pantheon: Built in 120AD as a Roman (pagan) temple for all gods, it was transformed into a church in 609 AD. Still, everyone calls it the Pantheon, which means “honor all Gods” in Greek. €5 entry fee. 
    • Largo di Torre Argentina: This is where Roman senators assassinated Emperor Julius Caesar by stabbing him 23 times to death in 44 BC. 

Day Two – 2/14
    • Colosseum: Gladiators ruins that once sat 50,000 guests and even had retractable shades. Tickets are €16 for this plus the next two sites, plus €2 if purchased online from the official site.
    • Roman Forum: These are the ruins of numerous important government buildings during the ancient Roman Empire. 
    • Palatine Hill: Where the aristocrats lived in the Roman Empire.
    • Arch of Constantine: Built in 302 AD and the largest surviving one of its kind, is right outside the Colosseum.
    • Vittoriano: Huge marble memorial to Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of the united Italy as we know it today.


Day Three – 3/14
    • Vatican City: 
        ◦ St. Peter’s Square: A huge ancient piazza in the core of Vatican City. Supposedly, it was built where Peter the Apostle was killed. 
        ◦ St. Peter’s Basilica: Free to enter, but dress code is very strict. Make sure your shoulders and knees are covered. This goes for all genders and ages. There is a slow moving-crowd-slash-line to get in, but I found it moved quickly enough when I went. Once in the basilica, you can climb up to the dome for iconic views. To the right from the entrance, there should be a “Cupola” sign. Follow the sign until at the ticket office, where you can purchase a ticket to either climb the whole way for €8 or one to take an elevator partway up for €10. As far as I know, you can only buy tickets (that aren’t with a guide) in person. 
        ◦ Vatican Museums. House the world-famous Sistine Chapel. You’ll pay €20 for entry, plus a €5 online booking fee if you book in advance on the official site, which I highly recommend you do. Entry to the Museums is free on the last Sunday of every month. Seeing Vatican City should take up a whole morning. 
    • Castel Sant’Angelo: Emperor Hadrian originally commissioned this as a mausoleum for himself and his family, but it’s since been used as a fortress, castle, and currently a museum. 

Amalfi Coast
Day One – 4/14
    • Tour Pompeii: Typically takes 2-3 hours and €18. Additional €12 is recommended for a guided tour.
    • Visit Herculaneum: Smaller but better preserved Pompeii.
Day Two – 5/14
    • Positano: This unreal village is the star of the whole area. For the best view, splurge on a meal at Le Sirenuse Hotel’s La Sponda Restaurant.
    • The Path of the Gods: Hike between Amalfi and Positano along the very top of the cliffs. Google “Sentiero degli Dei” and follow the route. It starts in Bomerano, which you can reach by SITA bus 5080 from Amalfi. It ends in Nocelle, the upper part of Positano. I definitely recommend doing it this direction, since it’s all downhill, and you’ll get better views. 
    • Amalfi: This is the town after which the area is named. It boasts a beautiful church, the Amalfi Cathedral, which you can enter for €3. 
    • Ravello: This tiny little village high up in the mountains has the area’s most famous villa – Villa Rufolo. Entry costs €8, and you can take the SITA bus 5110 from Amalfi. The ride takes 30 minutes.
Day Three – 6/14
    • Blue Grotto: This cave is probably the most famous attraction in Capri! The only way to avoid the long wait is to be the first ones out, but the best time for viewing is noon – 2pm, so it’s quite the dilemma. Tours departing from Marina Grande cost €18.
    • Piazzetta: This is the island’s most famous square. Be sure to stroll down the Via Camerelle while in the area.
    • Anacapri: The island of Capri actually has two towns; Capri and Anacapri. Anacapri is less crowded than Capri, and it has more artisanal shops, rather than just high-end boutiques. Ride the chairlift 12 minutes to Mount Solaro for a view (€12.
    • Villa San Michele: Entry costs €10 for some spectacular views.
    • Gardens of Augustus: Classic Capri viewpoint of the Faraglioni. Entry only costs €1.50!
Florence
Day One – 7/14
    • Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore (aka, the Duomo): It’s the third largest church in the world, was instrumental in the Renaissance, and is the symbol of Florence. Entry is free, but prepare for a massive line at least an hour long.
    • Cupola: Bruneschelli’s Dome, named after the architect who designed it, is actually the most impressive part of the entire church. Architecturally, it was the first of its kind. Climb up the steps for the view from the top. 
    • Campanile di Giotto: There’s another viewpoint - the cupola itself!
    • Battistero di San Giovanni: This is the building right across the main cathedral. The Byzantine-like mosaic inside was pretty cool in contrast to all the typical-Renaissance paintings. 
    • Crypt of Santa Reparata: A church ruins from 405AD inside the main church. 
    • Piazza della Repubblica: One of the main squares in Florence.
    • Piazza della Signoria: The best part is the Loggia dei Lanzi. 
    • Ponte Vecchio: This iconic bridge was originally a passageway so the Medicis didn’t have to walk with the commoners on their commutes from their palace. 
    • Accademia Gallery: The David. Go during at night on the select days they are open late.
    • Uffizi Gallery: “Offices” in Italian, this building used to be the Medici’s offices. Its most-famous art piece is the Birth of Venus painting. Entry costs €25, plus €4 for the skip-the-line online booking fee on the official site. 
    • Palazzo Pitti & Boboli Gardens: Another Medici palace.
Day Two – Pisa 8/14
    • Climb the leaning tower: Costs €20 and requires a time-slot.
    • Baptistery: Costs €7
    • Chiesa di Santa Maria della Spina
Cinque Terre
Day One - 9/14
    • Hike Monterosso to Vernazza to Corniglia
    • Eat at Nessun Dorma in Manarola
Venice
Day One – 10/14
    • Piazza San Marco: Main square 
        ◦ Basilica San Marco: €3 to enter 
        ◦ Campanile (the bell tower): Take the elevator up it for €10 
        ◦ Doge’s Palace: Entry is €25 
    • Bridge of Sighs: It’s named so because it connects to the prisons, and prisoners sighed while taking one last look over beautiful Venice as they walked through the bridge to their dooms.
    • Rialto Bridge: Another cool bridge
    • Accademia Bridge: Another bridge
Day Two – 11/14
    • Take a half-day trip to Burano and Murano: Islands from Venice
    • Fondaco dei Tedeschi: This shopping center has free rooftop views of Venice - book in advance

Milan
Day One – 12/14
    • See the Last Supper: Book early! Tickets to see Leonardo Da Vini’s masterpiece are available on the official site 3 months in advance. They cost €15, plus a €2 online fee, and allow you a 15-minute viewing of the famous painting in the Santa Maria delle Grazie church. 
    • Go to the Roof of the Duomo: Entrance to the roof costs €14 on foot or €16 by elevator, but €20 and €25 respectively if you add entry into the church itself.
